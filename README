Very simple proof of concept that Akka[0] actors run on android by example of the DiningHakkersOnFsm[1].

Unfortunately it requires Android 2.3, as akka uses java.util.concurrent.ConcurrentSkipListSet doesn't seem to be supported on the "older" platforms. Please correct me if I'm wrong here.

Also had to manually add the interface org.omg.CORBA.portable.IDLEntity, since com.eiao.uuid.UUID depends on it and it's not available on android.

Also, it took some time to find the right proguard settings.


I've captured a minute of the running emulator for those with no access to an Android 2.3.3 phone (which is probably just about everybody): http://www.vimeo.com/20303656
The video is still in the waiting line to be converted (as of 2011-02-23 00:34).
